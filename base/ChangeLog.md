### 0.21.1

+ Remove the `::=` and `::~` constructors in `AttrOp`, since they cannot really be used for anything, since they are pure functions.

### 0.21.0

+ New release to keep major version parity with the `haskell-gi` package, no changes otherwise.

### 0.20.8

+ Fix a bug which could lead to crashes when releasing boxed objects, see [issue #130](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/130).

### 0.20.7

+ Fix a memory leak in doConstructGObject.

### 0.20.6

+ Use g_object_new_with_properties instead of g_object_newv in
GLib versions 2.54 or later, to avoid a deprecation warning.

### 0.20.5

+ Run object finalizers in the main loop. The reason is that for
some types the destructor is not thread safe, and assumes that it
is being run from the same thread as the thread that created the object,
which can lead to crashes when using the threaded runtime.

### 0.20.4

+ Better error diagnostics for [wrapObject](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-ManagedPtr.html#v:wrapObject) and [newObject](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-gi-base/docs/Data-GI-Base-ManagedPtr.html#v:newObject).

### 0.20.3

+ Fixes for GHC 8.2.1 (and the corresponding `base-4.10.0`).

### 0.20.2

+ Fix fromGVariant for empty arrays, see [#91](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/issues/91) for details.

### 0.20.1

+ Add Data.GI.Base.CallStack, abstracting (and backporting to the
extent possible) the `HasCallStack` constraint present in newer
GHCs. Using this, we now include callstacks pervasively in the
generated code.

+ Improve the `WrappedPtr` implementation.

+ Deprecate `nulltoNothing`, it is better to simply fix the
overrides when necessary.

+ Make the semantics of GObject ownership transfer closer to those used by the Python bindings.
