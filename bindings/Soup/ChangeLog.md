### 2.4.16

+ The return value of [`cookieGetExpires`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gi-soup/docs/GI-Soup-Structs-Cookie.html#v:cookieGetExpires) is nullable, but was not marked as such in the introspection data.

### 2.4.15

+ Remove enable-overloading flags, and use instead explicit CPP checks for 'haskell-gi-overloading-1.0', see [how to disable overloading](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi/wiki/Overloading\#disabling-overloading).
