# haskell-gi-examples
haskell-gi introductory examples inspired by [GTK+ documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable).

## Examples implemented (for now!)
1. __Basic:__ [Basic example of GTK+ documents](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html).
2. __Hello world:__ [Hello World example of GTK+ documents](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-getting-started.html).
3. __Packed widgets:__ [Packing example of GTK+ documents](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.12/ch01s02.html).
4. __Builder:__ [Packing buttons with GtkBuilder example of GTK+ documents](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s03.html).

    In this example we should get the .ui path from the command arguments or construct a path to the same directory of the executable.
    You should either copy `builder.ui` file to the same directory of the executable, or give the full path to the `builder.ui` as the only argument to the program.
5. __Search Bar:__ [search-bar.c example in GTK repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/examples/search-bar.c)

    Although only `window` and `searchBar` `#show`ed in the original code but this results in a blank and unresponsive window. `#show`ing all components individually or `#showAll` of them at once at the end of the function solves the problem. I don't know whether this is a haskell-gi or the original code problem.
6. __Action Namespace:__ [actuion-namespace.c example in GTK repository](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/examples/action-namespace.c)

    This example shows how menu items belonging to different namespaces can be enabled/disabled together. If the commented out line compiled then items in "win" namespace are enabled or else stay disabled.

    This example gives critical messages if linked with gi-gio older than version 2.0.18. Although marked critical, these messages are harmless.

## How to compile and run examples
As the author is familiar only with Haskell stack, the examples are built and run by this tool (any suggestions are welcome).

The examples compiled and tested only on Windows 10. So on other environments some tweaks may be needed.

First of all you should not compile with ghc 8.2.* as it is subject to the overload bug. See [haskell-gi documentation](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi).

1. Install GTK+ in the MSYS2 environment of the stack. To do this use stack exec -- pacman ... commands in the [GTK+ windows installation guide](https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php) (excluding MSYS2 installation step).
2. Setup `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variables on Windows.
3. Be sure `\mingw64\bin` and `\usr\bin` are in path when compiling with stack.  
3. Compile the examples with stack.
4. Run the examples with stack exec
